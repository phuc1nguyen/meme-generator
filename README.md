# Meme Generator

The goal of this project is to build a "meme generator" – a multimedia application to dynamically generate memes, including an image with an overlaid quote. It’s not that simple though! Your content team spent countless hours writing quotes in a variety of filetypes. You could manually copy and paste these quotes into one standard format – but you’re going to over-engineer a solution to load quotes from each file to show off your fancy new Python skills.

### The application you build must:

- Interact with a variety of complex filetypes. This emulates the kind of data you’ll encounter in a data engineering role.
- Load quotes from a variety of filetypes (PDF, Word Documents, CSVs, Text files).
- Load, manipulate, and save images.
- Accept dynamic user input through a command-line tool and a web service. This emulates the kind of work you’ll encounter as a full stack developer.

This project will give you a hands-on opportunity to practice what you've learned in this course, such as:

- Object-oriented thinking in Python, including abstract classes, class methods, and static methods.
- DRY (don’t repeat yourself) principles of class and method design.
- Working with modules and packages in Python.
